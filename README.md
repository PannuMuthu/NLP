# NLP

This is the shared folder for Professor Zhong's research group on NLP. We are following the Stanford NLP course, CS224N (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/).
The folders are organized into coding assignments, PDFs of written assignments, handouts, lecture notes, and the research project.
